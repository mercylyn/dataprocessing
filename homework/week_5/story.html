                <h3>Life from a historical perspective</h3>
                    <p>
                        Starting with a historical introduction. We, the Homo
                        sapiens evolved 200 000 years before the present.
                        The evolution of different human species 2 millions years,
                        and the formation of the planet Earth was 4.5 billion years ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The migration of the sapiens to Europe was 40 000 years ago. However, the industrial
                        revolution started 200 years ago. Which included massive extiction of plants and animals.
                        What is the effect of all this on the human life? We are the dominant species nowadways;
                        are we happy with the choices we made and make as a
                        society or even country? And what does it mean for our health?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With this in mind, the data taken from the Organisation for
                        Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) helps us to visualize
                        the life of Europeans: Better Life Index by measuring the well-being of societies.
                        Zooming in on the Life-Expectancy, Self-Reported Health,
                        Air Pollution and Water Quality per country in Europe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the worldmap it is possible to select a country to view
                        the water quality and self-reported health of the people in
                        the barchart. The water quality is expressed in the subjective
                        appreciation of the water quality. (Question: In the city or area where you live,
                        are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the quality of water).
                        The indicator for self-reported health refers to people responding good
                        to the following question: "How is your health in general?".
